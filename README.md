# AAA: Algorithmique et Apprentissage Automatique (Algorithmic and Automatic Learning)

This repository contains several ipynb projects detailling various machine learning methods, as part of a data science class *(named AAA)* I attended during my engineer school curriculum, using `pandas`, `numpy` and `sklearn` libraries.

- [AAA-First_Analyse.ipynb](https://github.com/edabier/AAA-projects/blob/main/AAA-First_Analyse.ipynb) introduces basic DataFrame cleaning and visualization methods
- [AAA-Cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/edabier/AAA-projects/blob/main/AAA-cleaning.ipynb) goes in further detail about DataFrame cleaning
- [AAA-Log_RegDecisionTree.ipynb](https://github.com/edabier/AAA-projects/blob/main/AAA-Log_RegDecisionTree.ipynb) details the logistic regression method as well as the decision tree one and the concept of overfitting
- [AAA-GridSearch.ipynb](https://github.com/edabier/AAA-projects/blob/main/AAA-GridSearch.ipynb) details a method to optimize the parameters of the decision tree classifier (Grid Search)
- [AAA-Clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/edabier/AAA-projects/blob/main/AAA-Clustering.ipynb) details a clustering method (K-Means)
- [AAA-NLP.ipynb](https://github.com/edabier/AAA-projects/blob/main/AAA-NLP.ipynb) details several Natural Language Processing methods (visualization, cleaning, lemmatization, sentiment analysis, TF IDF)
- [projet_AAA.ipynb](https://github.com/edabier/AAA-projects/blob/main/projet_AAA.ipynb) is a final project in which I applied several of the previously discovered method to a given DataFrame
